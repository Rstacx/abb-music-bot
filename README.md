# Abb
Hi, I'm Abb ( Aziel, but better). Abb is the v14 version of [Aziel](https://github.com/Aziel). Abb is a work in progress, and any help or contributions you can give are greatly appreciated.

### Plan

 - ~~Add slash commands and handler~~
 - ~~Add message commands and handler~~
 - ~~Add event handler and error handlers~~
 - Add models, context, and message commands
 - Import features from v13 Aziel into Abb

### Features
Here are some features that might be added.

 - Moderation commands
 - Utility
 - Calendar commands
	 - Ability to create an embed with server events/real-world events.
	 - Ability to make it send a message/embed a specific channel / all channels (where it has the *SEND_MESSAGES* permission).
	 - Ability for the user to add/delete custom events.
	 - This will most likely be locked behind premium, later on.
 - Premium System
 - Sound effects library
	 - This will enable the user to search for a sound effect, the bot returns results, and the user clicks the most relevant. Then the bot sends the downloadable link and a 		preview.
 - Spotify and Soundcloud commands
	 - This will be used to look up playlists, artists, and users.
	 - There will be a dropdown where the user will choose whether to search on Spotify, Soundcloud, or both.
